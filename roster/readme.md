#Add your own folder here

Send a Pull Request (from a branch on your own fork) with your own folder.

Inside your folder should be a single readme.md file that contains some basic info about you, nicely formatted in MarkDown. Include your GitHub username, linked to your GitHub profile. Also link to your Twitter account, your LinkedIn page, a favorite photo, and any other relvant information or online presence you'd like to share with your classmates.

I have created an example folder [here](https://github.com/codefellows/sea-b26-foundations/tree/master/roster/Brook%20Riggio).
